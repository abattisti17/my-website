<h1>Nudging toward healthy financial behaviors.</h1>

<p class="project-summary"> 
	<b>Problem: </b>The client loses $40m / year because many of its customers are late on their bills, and aren't sure why
<br><br>
<b>Method: </b>Ethnographic interviews (w/customers & client retail employees), mixed-methods research (collaboration w/ quant team), sacrificial concepting.
<br><br>
<b>Solution: </b>A detailed taxonomy of late payers, including why they're late, nudges they respond best to, and how to find target them in customer database.
<br><br>
<b>Outcome: </b>We designed 3 targeted "nudge-experiments" to test live on client platform with metrics to evaluate success.</p>
