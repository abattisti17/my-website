<h1>Envisioning Dementia Inclusive Futures</h1>
<p>A workshop with Elder Care Alliance.</p>

<p><b>tldr;</b> We ran a workshop to co-design dementia-inclusive futures with the community.</p>

<p class="project-summary"> 
	<b>Background: Elder Care Alliance partners with Fern. </b>
</br>For their first annual "Celebration of Dementia Inclusive Arts & Community," Elder Care Alliance (ECA) partnered with Fern to run a participatory design workshop. Our goal was to co-invision future dementia-inclusive services and experiences that ECA could partner with adjacent organizations to provide. We collaborated with participants with a range of experience with dementia, ranging from those experiencing dementia, to their care partners, to professionals working with the dementia community. The event brought together organizations across the eldercare and dementia space, including the Institute on Aging, Alzheimers Association, and the Contemporary Jewish Museum. This work culminated in a community-driven experience roadmap for ECA.

<br><br>
<b>Workshop design: Experience today & envision tomorrow 
</b></br>
We designed the workshop activities to get participants: 
</br></br>
experiencing things they can do today to make their communities more dementia-inclusive, and 
envisioning ways organizations might collaborate to catalyze dementia-inclusiveness in the future. 
</br></br>
Key considerations for this workshop included making the activities accessible to people living with dementia (for example, by reducing the cognitive load of prompts and tasks), as well as designing for folks who are monolingual in a non-english language (for example, by designing for Cantonese interpreters at the event). 
</br></br>
Our event included 2 activities: 
</br></br>
<b>Activity 1: Prototyping Dementia-Inclusive Social Currents </b></br>
"How might we encourage conversations about dementia-inclusiveness today?" 
</br></br>
Participants were asked to brainstorm things they can do today to engage their communities to be more dementia-inclusive—digitally or in-person. Participants then selected their favorite idea and tried it outd. If sharing digitally via social media participants used a hashtag for the event. The goal was to get participants rapidly prototyping viral behaviors that make communities more dementia-inclusive. 
</br></br>
<b>Activity 2: Organization Collaboration Brainstorm & Roadmapping</b></br>
"Brainstorm ways organizations can collaborate on new dementia-inclusive programs & activities." 
</br></br>
Participants were asked to choose two of the organizations present at the event and brainstorm different ways in which those organizations can collaborate to make communities more dementia-inclusive. Participants used available materials—sticky notes, sharpies, etc—to draw up concepts that represented their vision. They then placed each concept on a timeline, based on how near-term or future-looking the concept is. (ie. "Stuff we can do today with little effort" vs. "Stuff we can do tomorrow with planning and more effort").
</br></br>
<b>A Community-powered Service Roadmap 
</b></br>
After the workshop, we took the concepts and timeline developed by participants back to the studio. We digitized them into an actionable roadmap that ECA could use to inform future dementia-inclusive programming.
</br></br>
<b>Impact & Challenges
Inspiring leadership & Incorrect hunches 
</b></br>
No plan goes off without a hitch. This plan was no different. One of the challenges that surprised us was that Activity 1 was less engaging than Activity 2. Our initial hunch was that the immediate and embodied nature of Activity 1 would make it universally appealing. In reality, participants gravitated toward Activity 2, potentially because the activity better fit existing schema for brainstorm activities. We also didn't anticipate the variety in how long participants stayed. Some participants stayed to create 1 concept, then moved on to another booth. Others stayed for the duration of the event. As such, some participants created more ideas than others. So representativeness was compromised somewhat. 
</br></br>
All-in-all, ECA was thrilled with the engagement and output from the workshop. We even had a surprise visit from the President (check) of ECA during the workshop, who co-created concepts with participants living with dementia.
