<h3> here is basically the paragraph explaining this. At Fern, we liked to structure our work in what we called "Research  Rounds." Basically they are 4-6 week research sprints that go from sampling, recruiting, research w participants, synthesis and delivery. The reason we liked them is for business development and methodological reasons. 1) Business development: the clients we worked with tended to have limited budgets. This allowed them  to have low cost options if they can only buy a small amount of work. And if they decide they want more, it is a la carte and simple to add more. Research Rounds are a low-risk way to work together and for us to deliver quick wins that prove the value of the partnership. 2) Methodology: Especially when working at the inception of a product or service, it is more effective to work in short sprints than in large monolithic projects. this way we can be refining our ideas quickly and often as we iteratively work toward higher confidence in our insights and our designs.  In this program, we had 5 Research Rounds. We started with a quick-win project: a revamp of their homepage messaging and a new donation UX flow, based in usability testing and case study research on donations, respectively. 

</br></br>

<b>Problem:</b> A national wireless company loses $40m / year because many of its customers are late on their bills.

</br></br>

<b>Methods:</b> Ethnographic interviews (w/ customers & client retail employees), Sacrificial concepting, Customer archetypes, Behavioral targeting (in collaboration w/ quant team).

</br></br>

<b>Deliverable:</b> We designed 3 "nudges" to test via our client's service channels, targeted at late payer archetypes our client could help the most.

</br></br>

<b>Outcome:</b> We launched the 3 "nudge-experiments". Built empathy w/in client team for late payers
