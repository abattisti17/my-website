<h1>Crowdfunding for a community-supported platform.</h1>

<p class="project-summary"> 
	<b>Problem: </b>The client had an engaged community on their platform, but no revenue model.
<br><br>
<b>Method: </b>Donation psychology literature review, donation trend analysis, and prototyping.
<br><br>
<b>Solution: </b>A new donation UX flow based on what's been shown to work.
<br><br>
<b>Outcome: </b>The UX is currently being built, with metrics in place to evaluate its effectiveness once it launches. </p>

<h3>A research participant sharing the parts of the client's platform they found most valuable. In our trend analysis we learned people are more likely to give right after they experience value. This helped us pin-point places to ask for donations.</h3>
