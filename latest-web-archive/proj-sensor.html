<h2>Understanding user perceptions of ambient sensing tech</h2>

<p>This was a 6-month solo project I did at Google from 2020-2021.</p>

<!-- CONFIDENTIALITY START -->

<p><b>My Role:</b> End-to-end research: study design, recruiting, conducting interviews, analyzing data, synthesizing data, storytelling, presentation
</p>

<p><b>The Problem:</b> Google is adopting a sensing technology across their hardware portfolio. Several Google product teams approached our research team to understand the value this tech can enable and their users' perceptions of its ambient sensing capabilities.
</p>

<!-- <img src="images/am_interview.png" alt="grid of logos: "> -->

<p><b>Approach:</b> Teams had hunches around experiences their users would find valuable. In addition to testing their hunches, I reframed the challenge to also understand broader opportunities in each of their product areas.
</p>

<p><b>The Methods: 2-stage research</b>
  <ul>
    <li><i>Unmoderated homework</i> to illuminate current experiences and evaluate concepts</li>
<li><i>1:1 in-depth interviews</i> with a subset of participants to dive deeper into perceptions</li>
</ul>
</p>
<!-- <img src="images/am_postits.png" alt="grid of logos: "> -->

<p><b>The Deliverables:</b>
<ul>
  <li>High-level strategy for near-term experience development
</li>
  <li>Long-term design strategy for each product team (including emerging target markets, opportunity zones, product / experience recommendations)
</li>
  <li>Participant perceptions of privacy and ambient sensing
</li>
  <li>Feedback on concepts
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p><b>The Outcomes:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Influence key decisions:</li>
  <ul>
    <li>Prioritize experiences enabled by sensing tech

  </li>
    <li>Which devices to include the sensing tech
  </li>
    <li>Roadmaps for each product team
  </li>
  </ul>
<li>
New partnerships with cross-functional teams for future research
</li><li>
Support from VP leadership on ambient sensing initiatives</li>
</ul>
